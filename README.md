1. **Custom Compression Quality** - Users can select the desired image compression level (1-100).
2. **Fast & Efficient Processing** - Uses Sharp.js for high-speed image compression.
3. **Secure Authentication** - Users must log in using OAuth (Auth0) to access the service.
4. **User-Friendly UI** - A clean, dark-themed interface designed with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
5. **Cloud Storage with MongoDB GridFS** - Images are stored securely on MongoDB Atlas.
6. **Download & Preview** - Compressed images are available for preview and download.
7. **Scalable & Optimized** - Designed for high performance and easy deployment.
